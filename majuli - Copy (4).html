<p>Mājuli or Majuli (mazuli)[1] is a river island in the Brahmaputra River, Assam and in 2016 it became the first island to be made a district in India.[2] In the 1790s the island covered an area of 1300 sqare kilometers or (500 sq mi).[3] It had an area of 1,255 square kilometres (485 sq mi) at the beginning of the 20th century,[4] but having lost significantly to erosion it covers 352 square kilometres (136 sq mi) as at 2014.[5] Majuli has shrunk as the river surrounding it has grown.[6]

  The island is formed by the Brahmaputra River in the south and the Kherkutia Xuti, an anabranch of the Brahmaputra, joined by the Subansiri River in the north.[7] Mājuli island is accessible by ferries from the city of Jorhat. The island is about 300–400 kilometres (186–249 mi) east from the state's largest city —Guwahati.It was formed due to course changes by the river Brahmaputra and its tributaries, mainly the Lohit. Mājuli is the abode of the Assamese neo-Vaishnavite culture.[8]
  
  Majuli is since 2004 in the UNESCO Tentative List for nomination as a World Heritage Site.[9]
  Mājuli is 20 km from Jorhat. One can take the bus or a hired taxi to the Nimati Steamer Ghat from where ferry services ply. The distance takes over three hours to cover, with three bus rides and two ferry rides.

On the north bank is the river Subansiri and on the south bank, the mighty Brahmaputra has exited[clarification needed] the island from the mainland. Lakhimpur town is to the north and Golaghat is to its southwest. The town of Sibsagar is on the southeast and Jorhat is to the south. On the extreme east is Dibrugarh District.
