  Mizoram (English: /mɪˈzɔːrəm/ (listen)) is a state in Northeast India, with Aizawl as its seat of government and capital city. The name of the state is derived from "Mizo", the self-described name of the native inhabitants, and "Ram", which in the Mizo language means "land." Thus "Mizo-ram" means "land of the Mizos".[4] Within India's northeast region, it is the southernmost landlocked state, sharing borders with three of the Seven Sister States, namely Tripura, Assam and Manipur. The state also shares a 722-kilometre (449 mi) border with the neighbouring countries of Bangladesh and Myanmar.[5]

Like several other northeastern states of India, Mizoram was previously part of Assam until 1972, when it was carved out as a Union Territory. In 1986 the Indian Parliament adopted the 53rd amendment of the Indian Constitution, which allowed for the creation of the State of Mizoram on 20 February 1987, as India's 23rd state.[6]

According to a 2011 census, in that year Mizoram's population was 1,091,014. It is the 2nd least populous state in the country.[7] Mizoram spans over an area of approximately 21,087 square kilometres,[8] of which approximately 91% is forested.[9]

About 95% of Mizoram's population descends from a diverse tribal origin. Mizos first began to settle the area in the 16th century, coming in waves of immigration from Southeast Asia. This immigration lasted through the 18th century.[10] Among all of the states of India, Mizoram has the highest concentration of tribal people. The Mizoram people are currently protected under the Indian constitution as a Scheduled Tribe.[11] Mizoram is one of three states of India with a Christian majority (87%).[12] Its people belong to various Christian denominations, being mostly Presbyterians in the north and Baptists in the south.

Mizoram is a highly literate agrarian economy. Slash-and-burn farming, also known as Jhoom farming is the most common form of farming.[13] In recent years, the jhoom farming practices have been steadily replaced with a significant horticulture and bamboo products industry.[14][15] The state's gross state domestic product for 2012 was estimated at ₹69.91 billion (US$880 million).[8] About 20% of Mizoram's population lives below the poverty line, with 35% rural poverty as of 2014.[16] The state has about 871 kilometres of national highways, with NH–54 and NH–150 connecting it to Assam and Manipur respectively. It is also a growing transit point for trade with Myanmar and Bangladesh.[1

The Foreigners (Protected Areas) Order 1958, a continuation of a protectionist British colonial rule, requires visitors to Mizoram to have one of two passes.

Domestic tourists
The state requires Indian citizens to have an Inner Line Permit. This is available from the Liaison officer, government of Mizoram in Kolkata, Silchar, Shillong, Guwahati and New Delhi. Those arriving by air can obtain a 15-day visit pass at Lengpui airport, Aizawl by submitting photographs and paying the fee of ₹120 (US$1.50).[114]

International tourists
Almost all foreign nationals can get the required Protected Area Permit on arrival, and face the same requirements as domestic tourists. However, they additionally have to register themselves with state police within 24 hours of arrival, a formality that most resorts can provide. Citizens of Afghanistan, China and Pakistan and foreign nationals having their origin in these countries are required to get the pass through the Indian consulate or from the Ministry of Home Affairs in New Delhi, before they arrive in Mizoram.[114]

Attractions
Mizoram is a place with flora and fauna rich landscape and pleasant climate.[115] The tourism ministry regulates the maintenance and upgrade of tourist lodges throughout the state.[citation needed]

The state is a bird watcher's destination. For Mrs. Hume's pheasant (Syrmaticus humiae), Mizoram is a stronghold.[116] Wild water buffalo, Sumatran rhinoceros, elephants and other mammals have been spotted in the past.[117][118][119]

Mizoram is also one of few places where a Winterline phenomenon is visible.
