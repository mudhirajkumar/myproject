<p>Kausani (Kumaoni: Kôsānī) is a hill station and Village situated in Bageshwar district in the state of Uttarakhand, India. It is famous for its scenic splendour and its spectacular 300 km-wide panoramic view of Himalayan peaks like Trisul, Nanda Devi and Panchchuli. Mahatma Gandhi called this place the 'Switzerland of India',[4][5] due to similarity in landscapes.

  History
  During Independence of India in 1947, Kausani was situated in the Almora District[6] till 15 September 1997 after which Bageshwar district was carved out of Almora district.[7] On 9 November 2000, the State of Uttarakhand was created from the Himalayan and adjoining northwestern districts of Uttar Pradesh.[8]

Kausani is located 52 km (32 mi) north of Almora, a major hill station and the historical capital of Kumaon Kingdom.[11] Kausani lies in the Kumaon division and is situated 123 km (76 mi) North-East of Nainital, the Headquarters of Kumaon. Nearby Towns include Garur (14 km (8.7 mi)) and Someshwar (12 km (7.5 mi)). It has an average elevation of 1,890 m (6,200 ft) above mean Sea Level. Kausani lies atop a ridge amidst dense pine trees overlooking Someshwar valley on one side and Garur and Katyuri valley[4] on the other on Almora-Bageshwar-Didihat Highway. Kausani is a part of the Lesser Himalayas, a region watered by rivers like Kosi, Gomti and Ramganga.[12] Their banks, known as seras, are highly fertile
  
  Anashakti Ashram is a quiet and revered place where Mahatma Gandhi spent some days[20] and wrote his commentary of Anashakti Yog.[21] The KMVN (Kumaon Mandal Vikas Nigam) resthouse in Kausani is an ideal place to stay and it provides panoramic views of the mountains.
