  History
  Lunglei was the Capital of South Lushai Hill Districts for 10 years from 1888, as was Aizawl for the North Hill Districts.[2] The two were united in 1898. Lunglei is the second-largest town in Mizoram and was an important town until the partition of India as it had direct access to Chittagong, a big city in Bangladesh which made Lunglei the commercial and education centre.[3] As of 1912, there were only 2 shops in Lunglei 1922 which increased to 4 shopes in 1922. The first Jeepable road to Lunglei was made only in the 1950s.[4] on 1 March 1966, the MNF declared unilateral Mizo Independence and attacked Assam Rifles post at Lunglei, captured the SDO and seized Rs 18 Lakhs from the Govt Treasury.
