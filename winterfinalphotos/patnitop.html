  Patnitop is a hill station, located, between Ramban Town and Udhampur city in the Ramban district of Jammu and Kashmir, India.[1] It is in located on the Jammu-Srinagar National Highway (which is part of National Highway 44, formerly 1A), 112 km (70 mi) from Jammu, on the way from Udhampur to Srinagar. Situated on a plateau in the Shivalik belt of the Himalayas, Patnitop sits at an altitude of 2,024 m (6,640 ft). The river Chenab flows in close proximity to this location.[2] Patnitop lies in District Udhampur of Jammu And Kashmir
  nowfall and avalanche in winter at Patnitop used to obstruct the Jammu-Srinagar National Highway a few times every winter and causes long queues of vehicles, sometimes for days. These problems were mitigated by the opening of the Dr. Syama Prasad Mookerjee Tunnel. At 9.2 km (6 mi), it is India's longest road tunnel. It starts from about 2 km (1 mi) from Chenani town south of Patnitop to Nashri village north of Patnitop, reducing the distance from Jammu to Srinagar by 31 km (19 mi) and bypassing Patnitop.[3]

  The Patnitop Ropeway
  Skyview Patnitop is India's highest ropeway and the largest Indo-French collaboration in mountain infrastructure development was built in a record time of 2.4 years under the Public-Private Partnership (PPP) model. The ropeway started its commercial operations on July 20 ,2020 . A month after starting its commercial operation, the Skyview Patnitop by Empyrean, an initiative by Empyrean Skyview Projects Private Limited (ESPPL), was awarded the best adventure tourism destination 2019 .It features India's highest ropeway with over 65 meters of ground clearance and the longest span of 849 meters between eight towers . The Ropeway reduces the travel time between sanget & patnitop to 15 minutes from the earlier 1.5 hours
