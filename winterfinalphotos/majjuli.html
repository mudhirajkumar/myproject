  Mājuli or Majuli (mazuli)[1] is a river island in the Brahmaputra River, Assam and in 2016 it became the first island to be made a district in India.[2] In the 1790s the island covered an area of 1300 sqare kilometers or (500 sq mi).[3] It had an area of 1,255 square kilometres (485 sq mi) at the beginning of the 20th century,[4] but having lost significantly to erosion it covers 352 square kilometres (136 sq mi) as at 2014.[5] Majuli has shrunk as the river surrounding it has grown.[6]

  The island is formed by the Brahmaputra River in the south and the Kherkutia Xuti, an anabranch of the Brahmaputra, joined by the Subansiri River in the north.[7] Mājuli island is accessible by ferries from the city of Jorhat. The island is about 300–400 kilometres (186–249 mi) east from the state's largest city —Guwahati.It was formed due to course changes by the river Brahmaputra and its tributaries, mainly the Lohit. Mājuli is the abode of the Assamese neo-Vaishnavite culture.[8]
  
  Majuli is since 2004 in the UNESCO Tentative List for nomination as a World Heritage Site 
  The island was a long, narrow piece of land called Majoli (land in the middle of two parallel rivers) that had the Brahmaputra flowing in the north and the Burhidihing flowing in the south until they met at Lakhu. It was once known as Ratnapur and was the capital of the powerful Sutiya kingdom.[10][11] Frequent earthquakes in the period 1661–1696 set the stage for a catastrophic flood in 1750 that continued for 15 days, which is mentioned in historical texts and reflected in folklore. As a result of this flood, part of the Brahmaputra discharged southward into what was the Burhidihing's lower channel and Mājuli island was formed.

  The Ahom king Pratap Singha built a rampart in Majuli called Meragarh. Lakshmi Singha's grant of 1776 says it Majuli Pradesh and refers its Kamalabari Satra, Agnichapori, Gajala Satra and the river Tuni. During Moamaria rebellion, Majuli was controlled by Haoha, a moamaria rebel leader[12]
  
  The Burhidihing's point of confluence moved 190 km east and the southern channel which was the Burhidihing became the Burhi Xuti. The northern channel, which was previously the Brahmaputra, became the Luit Xuti. In due course, the flow in the Luit Xuti decreased, and it came to be known as the Kerkota Xuti; and the Burhi Xuti expanded via erosion to become the main Brahmaputra River.
  
  The locals speak in Assamese and Mising language mainly. A few speak in the Deori language as well.
  
  Mājuli has been the cultural capital of Assamese civilisation since the 16th century; based on written records describing the visit of Srimanta Sankardeva — a 16th-century social reformer. Sankardeva, a pioneer of the medieval-age neo-Vaishnavite movement, preached a monotheist form of Hinduism called Vaishnavism and established monasteries and hermitages known as satra on the islet.
  
  The island soon became the leading center of Vaishnavinism with the establishment of these satras. After the arrival of the British, Majuli was under the rule of the British until India gained independence in 1947. It is as of 2016 the world's biggest river island
