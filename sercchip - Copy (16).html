  Serchhip is the headquarters town of Serchhip district in the Indian state of Mizoram, and also the headquarters of Serchhip Sadar subdivision. It lies in the central part of Mizoram, and 112 km away from the State capital city of Aizawl. The district has the highest literacy all over India. The origin of the name comes from citrus trees found on top of the first hill of the then Serchhip village. The word meaning of Ser-chhip is 'citrus-on-top'. In addition to the former Serchhip village, the Town Area now included New Serchhip and Chhiahtlang villages
  The district consists of number of towns and villages lying around Serchhip. Thenzawl is the second biggest town after Serchhip. It is one of the few flat areas with beautiful grassy landscape. Nearby Thenzawl is a spectacular waterfall called Vantawng Falls (meaning Heaven's reaching fall). This beautiful stepped fall is easily accessible by road, and it is a place where one can hear the calling of nature silently.

Paragliding is a new sport for the people of Serchhip town. Fédération Aéronautique Internationale International Paragliding Accuracy Championship was held in Serchhip for the year 2020 and has become a major attraction in Mizoram.[4]

Vantawng Khawhthla::
Main article: Vantawng Falls
The most famous waterfall in Mizoram, Vantawng Falls, is about 4 km to the south of Thenzawl (sub-division) at Lau River. The height of this waterfall is roughly measured to be about 220 m. The artistic design like seven rounded storey cliff of this falls is very attractive. It was said that Vantawnga was a great swimmer who was supposed to have lived in a nearby village who could swim upwards to the falls when the volume of the water was at its peak. When the Ngawidawh people urged him to swim upwards of the falls again, a large log carried by the flood had hit him and died at the spot. As such, the falls was named after him. It was also said that the Mualţhuam sub-clan who had once settled in Mizoram believed and worshipped the spirit of this waterfall. It is about 24 km from the headquarters town of Serchhip.

Zoluti Hriatrengna Lung::
Word meaning: Hratrengna - Memory; Lung - Stone.It could be presumed that Mary Winchester (ZOLUTI, as called by the Mizo people), taken as captive on 23 January 1871 by Mizo Chief Bengkhuaia of Kawlri was a root of Christianity in Mizoram. The spot, most of the writers and historians accepted to be the place where Zoluti was handed over to the British Official on 21 January 1872 is AW-A MUAL at Kawlri Tlang near Serchhip Kawnpui.In this place the Kristian Ṭhalai Pawl (Christian Youth Fellowship), Serchhip Vengchung Branch had erected a stone on 5 January 1994 in memory of Zoluti, daughter of Dr. Winchester, a manager in one of the Assam Tea Garden.However, the place was a historical agenda which had since long been debated between writers, historians and the people of Sailàm, Serchhip and Thenzawl. Till today, the question remains unsettled. There is no historical fact as to where Zolûti was handed over to the British official.The army column called The Lushai Expeditionary Force (Vailian Pahnihna) specially entrusted to bring back the white maid Zolûti was commanded by Lt. Col. T. H. Lewin, the Mizo people named him Pu Thangliana, who wrote the book A fly on the Wheel, in which he put the following lines:-

"...She (Zolûti) appeared, during her long stay with her kidnapper to have altogether forgotten English language, but on the officer fumbling in his pocket, and demanding whether she would like to have a sweet, her memory was at once refreshed and she held out her hand, showing that she understood what had been said." -(page 277, A fly on the Wheel)

Chhingpuii Thlan::
Word meanings: Thlàn - Tomb; Nl - Abbv. of Nula (Unmarried woman), Tv - Tlangval (Unmarried man)Chhingchhîp Branch YMA had erected a stone in memory of Nl. Chhingpuii at about 4 km north of Chhingchhip just above the Indian National Highway No. 54.Nl. Chhíngpuii (of Ruanzáwl sub-Village) was known for her beauty. They were in deep attachment with Tv. Kaptluanga. Meanwhile, Lalnawta, son of a village council elder, also loved her, but could not win her heart and then tried to revenge upon her lover. He made the evil spirit get inside Kâptluanga and he began seriously ill and could not move out at all.Even after that a love feeling inside Chhingpuii did not fade away. When she set out to her daily routine of going to Lo (jhum or farm) also, if she went along with other bachelors, she afraid that her lover, Kaptluanga's heart would have inflamed. So, she used to set off to lo along with an old man Ralteawmkhauha.It was on that very morning that she was caught by the enemies (during that time the second most famous civil war, Chhak leh Tlang Indo, East and West War 1877 - 1880 was going on) and she died at the hands of her captors, led by Thangzika (of Tachhip Village), though she had pleaded vehemently to save her life. It is said that her beauty did not fade even after her death.
