<p>Amboli is a hill station in south Maharashtra, India. At an altitude of 690 m (2,260 ft) it is the last hill station before the coastal highlands of Goa.

  Amboli lies in the Sahayadri Hills of Western India, one of the world's "Eco Hot-Spots"[citation needed] and it abounds in unusual flora and fauna. However, as in the other parts of the Sahaydri Hills, denudation of the forest cover and unregulated government-assisted development are gradually ruining an once-pristine environment.[original research?]
  
  Historically, Amboli village came into being as one of the staging posts along the road from Vengurla port to the city of Belgaum, which was extensively used by the British to supply their garrisons in south and central India.
  
  The source of the Hiranyakeshi river lies in the hills around Amboli village, and an ancient Shiva temple (called Hiranyakeshwar) sits at the cave where the water emerges.[citation needed] The main attraction for tourists is the incredibly-high rainfall (7 m average, per year) and the numerous waterfalls and mist during the monsoons. Legend has it that there are 108 Shiva temples in and around Amboli, of which only a dozen have been uncovered, one as recently as 2005.[citation needed] Amboli is also well know for sending large number of youngsters to serve Indian Army. In Amboli, it is hard to find a house which doesn't have at least one person who is serving in Indian Army or has served Indian Army. Shahid Soldier Pandurang Mahadev Gawade, was also from Amboli, who attained martyrdom while fighting five Lashkar terrorists at Drug Mulla village in Kashmir's Kupwara district on May 22, 2016, was posthumously awarded Shaurya Chakra on the eve of 68th Republic Day. Additionally, the interesting fact of the village is that many men had also served for British army in the pre-independence era
  
  There are in total 8 places that are listed by Maharashtra Tourism Development Corporation (MTDC). Amboli Waterfall, Hiranyakeshi(Shiv Mandir and ancient cave), Kavalesat (Reverse waterfall point), Amboli Forest (Rich with flora and fauna), Ganesh Kond(waterway/river), and the entire area is full of greenery and beautiful sceneries. People at the village are highly dependent on farming for daily livelihood, as a results, entire village is surrounded by rice plantation during the rainy season. People are very simple and helpful. Similarly, Amboli has several hotels and resorts but it is preferable to stay with locals and try local cuisine.
