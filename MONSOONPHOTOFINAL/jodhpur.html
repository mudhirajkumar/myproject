  Jodhpur (/ˈdʒoʊdpʊr/; pronounced [ˈd͡ʒoːd̪ʱpʊr] pronunciation (help·info)) is the second-largest city in the Indian state of Rajasthan and officially the second metropolitan city of the state. It was formerly the seat of the princely state of Jodhpur State. Jodhpur was historically the capital of the Kingdom of Marwar, which is now part of Rajasthan. Jodhpur is a popular tourist destination, featuring many palaces, forts, and temples, set in the stark landscape of the Thar Desert. It is popularly known as the "Blue City" among people of Rajasthan and all over India.[1] It serves as the administrative headquarters of the Jodhpur district and Jodhpur division.

The old city circles the Mehrangarh Fort and is bounded by a wall with several gates.[11] The city has expanded greatly outside the wall, though over the past several decades. Jodhpur lies near the geographic centre of the Rajasthan state, which makes it a convenient base for travel in a region much frequented by tourists.[1] The city featured in The New York Times's "52 Places to Go in 2020".[12]

The city is also home to several educational institutions, the most prominent being All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Jodhpur, Indian Institute of Technology Jodhpur, Dr. Sampurnanand Medical College, DSRRAU Jodhpur, and National Law University, Jodhpur, and many research institutes, such as Indian Space Research Organisation, Defence Research and Development Organisation, Central Arid Zone Research Institute, Arid Forest Research Institute, and Desert Medicine Research Centre are also located in the city.
