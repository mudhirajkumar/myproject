<p>Guwahati (/ɡuːəˈhɑːti/, Assamese: [guwaɦati]; formerly rendered Gauhati, /ɡaʊˈhɑːti/) is the biggest city of the Indian state of Assam and also the largest metropolis in northeastern India. Dispur, the capital of Assam, is in the circuit city region located within Guwahati and is the seat of the Government of Assam. A major riverine port city along with hills, and one of the fastest growing[12] cities in India, Guwahati is situated on the south bank of the Brahmaputra.[13] It is called the ''Gateway to North East India''.[14][15]

  The ancient cities of Pragjyotishpura and Durjaya (North Guwahati) were the capitals of the ancient state of Kamarupa.[16] Many ancient Hindu temples like the Kamakhya Temple, Ugratara Temple, Basistha Temple, Doul Govinda Temple, Umananda Temple, Navagraha Temple, Sukreswar Temple, Rudreswar Temple, Manikarneswar Temple, Aswaklanta Temple, Dirgheshwari Temple, Asvakranta Temple, Lankeshwar Temple, Bhubaneswari Temple, Shree Ganesh Mandir, Shree Panchayatana Temple, Noonmati, and the like, are situated in the city, giving it the title of "The City of Temples".[17]
  
  Guwahati lies between the banks of the Brahmaputra River and the foothills of the Shillong plateau, with LGB International Airport to the west and the town of Narengi to the east. The North Guwahati area, to the northern bank of the Brahmaputra, is being gradually incorporated into the city limits. The noted Madan Kamdev is situated 30 kilometres (19 miles) from Guwahati. The Guwahati Municipal Corporation, the city's local government, administers an area of 216 square kilometres (83 sq mi),.[3] At the same time, the Guwahati Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) is the planning and development body of Greater Guwahati Metropolitan Area.[5] Guwahati is the largest city in Northeast India.[4]
  
  The Guwahati region hosts diverse wildlife including rare animals such as Asian elephants, pythons, tigers, rhinoceros, gaurs, primate species, and endangered birds
  Guwahati was a Mughal station at the time of their occupation of Kamrup (1633–59, 1662–69, 1679–81). During the 17th-century, Guwahati was taken and retaken by Muslims and Ahoms eight times in fifty years but in 1681 it became the residence of the Ahom governor of lower Assam and in 1786 the capital of the Ahom raja. After Battle of Itakhuli, Guwahati permanently came under the seat of the Borphukan, the civil-military authority of the Lower Assam region appointed by the Ahom kings. The Borphukan's residence was in the present Fancy Bazaar area, and his council-hall, called Dopdar, was about 300 yards (270 m) to the west of the Bharalu stream. The Majindar Baruah, the personal secretary of the Borphukan, had his residence in the present-day deputy commissioner's residence.[27]

From the time of Gadadhar Singha the ahom kings paid their attention to building several temples in various religious sites at Guwahati: Kamakhya, Aswakranta, Sukreswar, Umananda, Dirgheswari, Vasisthasram and adorned its different entry passes with masonry gates.

The Mughal invaded Kamrup during the 17th century but were defeated by the Ahoms in the Battle of Saraighat (1671) and Battle of Itakhuli (1682) in the outskirts of Guwahati. The Boatyard in Dighalipukhuri was used by the Ahoms during the medieval times.[28]

Medieval constructions include temples, ramparts, and other structures in the city.[29][30]

During the Burmese rule in Assam between 1817 and 1825, Guwahati was held by the Burmese commander Mingimaha Tilwa and Mingimaha Bandula with 7000 troops. This led to the Burmese come in face to face with the East India Company based in Bengal. After securing Guwahati, Maha Bandula left 1000 troops with Mingimaha Tilwa in charge and returned back to Ava in Myanmar
