  Ahom capital
Jorhat was the last capital of the Ahom Kingdom, as a planned town under royal patronage. It is often spelt as "Jorehaut" during the British reign. In 1794, the Ahom King Gaurinath Singha shifted the capital from Sivasagar, erstwhile Rangpur to Jorhat. Many tanks were built around the capital city by the Ahom royalty such as Rajmao Pukhuri or Borpukhuri, Buragohain Pukhuri, Bolia Gohain Pukhuri, Kotoki Pukhuri and Mitha Pukhuri. This town was a flourishing and commercial metropolis.

Under Konbaung empire
The town was occupied by the Burmese Konbaung dynasty between 1817 - 1825. The Burmese left the commander Mingimaha Tilwa in charge of the area who appointed Jogeswar Singha as the new puppet King in 1821. Later when the deposed king Chandrakanta Singha tried to fight back, Bagyidaw (1819 â€“ 1837), the 7th King of Burma sent the greatest of his generals Mingimaha Bandula with 20,000 troops (including 10,000 Kamti Shan and Kachin levies) who defeated Chandrakanta Singha at Mahgarh near Jorhat and reestablish Burmese authority in Assam. The defeat of Chandrakanta on June 12, 1822 mark the start of the Burmese rule in Assam[6] and Burmese commander Mingimaha Tilwa was made the king. Maha Bandula then returned back to Ava in Myanmar.

Under British Rule
The British force under the stewardship of David Scott and Captain Richard arrived in Jorhat in 1824. Colonel Alfred Richards led the British forces against the Burmese and defeats them at Rangpur.

After the defeat of the Burmese in the First Anglo-Burmese War, the British reinstalled the Ahom king Purandar Singha.[7] Finally in 1840, British deposed Purandar Singha and it marked the start of British rule in Assam.

From the very first decade of the British rule, revolutionaries like Gomdhar Konwar, Dhananjay Borgohain, Jeuram Dihingia Baruah , and Peuli Phukan emerged. The British system of administration came into vogue in the year 1839 with an established Police Thana. During the great Sepoy Mutiny, Maniram Dewan and Piyali Barua were publicly hanged here in 1858.

In 1885, a narrow-gauge railway, Jorehaut Provincial Railway, became operational. In time, this contributed to the rapid growth of the tea industry.[8]
