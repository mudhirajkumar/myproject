  History
  Yelagiri or Elagiri is a small hill station located in between the towns of Vaniyambadi and Jolarpettai (Tamil Nadu, India). The hill station dates back to the British colonial days.
  
  "The Whole of Yelagiri was once the private property of the Yelagiri Zamindar Family. It was taken over by the government of India during the Early 1950s. The house of the Yelagiri Zamindars still exists in Reddiyur."[3]
  
  British administered Elagiri (Neelagiri) or Swami Malai or Kolli Malai. During 1960's Yelagiri was refuge to people groups who were involved in Emergency Rule of India. Their near-dynasty was terminated after withdrawal of Emergency Rule. It was left uninhabited until French Missionary Fr. Francis Guezou (Salesian) first arrived who helped Jawadhu Hills people to inhabit the hills. Yelagiri is now over populated by India's corporatism, political ventures and local tourism, since 2007 onwards.

However, the district administration has now taken up the task of developing Yelagiri Hills into a tourist destination by promoting adventure sports such as paragliding and rock climbing.[4]
  
  Yelagiri is one of the famous places for trekkers in India. The hill station is located at a height of 1410.6 meters above sea level. Yelagiri comprises 14 hamlets and a number of temples spread over several hills.
