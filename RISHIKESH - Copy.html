<p>Rishikesh, also spelt as Hrishikesh, is a city near Dehradun in Dehradun district of the Indian state Uttarakhand. It is situated on the right bank of the Ganges River and is a pilgrimage town for Hindus, with ancient sages and saints meditating here in search of higher knowledge.[1][2] There are numerous temples and ashrams built along the banks of the river.[3]

  It is known as the "Gateway to the Garhwal Himalayas" and "Yoga Capital of the World".[1][4][5][6] The city has hosted the annual "International Yoga Festival" on the first week of March since 1999.[7][8] Rishikesh is a vegetarian-only and alcohol-free city.[9]
  
  The Tehri Dam is just 86 km (53 mi) away and Uttarkashi, a popular yoga destination, is 170 km (110 mi) uphill on the way to Gangotri. Rishikesh is the starting point for travelling to the four Chota Char Dham pilgrimage places: Badrinath, Kedarnath, Gangotri, and Yamunotri. It is a starting point for Himalayan tourist destinations such as Harsil, Chopta, Auli, and summer and winter trekking destinations like Dodital, Dayara Bugyal, Kedarkantha, Har Ki Dun for camping and panoramic Himalayan views.
  
  In September 2015, the Indian Minister of Tourism Mahesh Sharma announced that Rishikesh and Haridwar would be the first "twin national heritage cities".[10] As of 2021, Rishikesh has a total population of 322,825 with the tehsil including the city and its 93 surrounding villages.[11]
  
  The city is governed by Rishikesh Municipal Corporation and tehsil.
  In February 1968, the Beatles visited Maharishi Mahesh Yogi's ashram in Rishikesh, attracted by his Transcendental Meditation.[35] The Beatles composed numerous songs during their time at the ashram, many of which appear on the band's self-titled double album, also known as the "White Album".[36] Western fans arrived seeking similar experiences, resulting in new yoga and meditation centers that fueled Rishikesh's nickname as the "Yoga Capital of the World".[1] Many of these Westerners have undergone training to become certified yoga teachers.[2][37][38]

The city's Sivananda Nagar houses the Sivananda Ashram and Divine Life Society, founded by Swami Sivananda. The Ram Jhula and Lakshman Jhula suspension bridges are accompanied by temples with additional ashrams near Swargashram along the eastern riverbank. Neelkanth Mahadev Temple is located in the forest, 28 km (17 mi) from Rishikesh, while Vashishtha Guha, a cave used by the sage Vashishtha, is 21 km (13 mi) north of the area.[39][40]

Activities
Ganga Arti At Triveni Ghat In Rishikesh
Ganga Aarti At Triveni Ghat
The Ganga Aarti (also known as Maha Aarthi) is performed at dusk at the Triveni Ghat. This popular Hindu religious ritual involves playing music and providing religious offerings to a fire.[41]

In 1939, the British completed construction on a 137 m (450 ft) long iron suspension bridge on Ganges River at the spot where Lakshman (Rama’s brother) crossed the Ganges on a jute rope.[42]


Rafting in Rishikesh
Rishikesh offers many rafting options along the Ganges from Grades I-IV.[43] Rishikesh has India's highest bungee jumping at 83m over a rocky cliff, which has been experienced by over 100,000 tourists.[44] The longest flying fox (also known as a zipline) in Asia is in Rishikesh with a length of 1 km and speeds of 140 km per hour.[44]

Riverside Camps
According to environmental activists, "These camps are not only in violation of Forest (Conservation) Act 1980, but also the Environment (Protection) Act 1986, as well as the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act 1974, as it is leading to pollution of Ganga by discharging effluent, throwing of solid waste directly and adversely affecting the ecological integrity of the river system."

Environmental activists allege that these camps, which are established as temporary sites, do not have adequate sewage and sanitation facilities, disturb the habitat of wild animals, and "affect the peace, tranquility, and serenity of the forest area. [...] At the campsites, the camp owners permit employees and the visitors to have food and alcohol. They leave empty bottles, cans, unconsumed food and waste including bones and filth in and around the campsite."

Camping in Rishikesh
Camping in Rishikesh
In a 2008 study on the beach camps between Kaudiyala and Rishikesh, experts from the Govind Ballabh Pant Himalayan Environment and Development Institute—R. K. Maikhuri, Nihal Farukhi and Tarun Budhal—found that wildlife conservation standards and norms, particularly for waste management, were routinely disregarded.

A bench headed by the National Green Tribunal chairperson Justice Swatanter Kumar on 1 April 2015 heard a plea filed by the non-governmental organisation Social Action for Forest and Environment (SAFE). The National Green Tribunal has sought explanations from the Government of India and the Government of Uttarakhand on the "unregulated" operation of rafting camps on the banks of Ganga between Shivpuri and Rishikesh in Uttarakhand. The state government has assured the tribunal that it would not grant permission to any new camp till the next hearing in May.[45][46][47][48][49][50]

As the seriousness of issue "The National Green Tribunal," a bench headed by Justice U. D. Salve has rejected permission to rafting camps operating in Rishikesh and slammed the Ministry of Environment and Forests and the Government of Uttarakhand for not filing their replies in the case and directed them to file their response.[51][52]
