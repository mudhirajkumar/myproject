<p>Srinagar (English: /ˈsriːnəɡər/ (listen), Kashmiri pronunciation: [siriːnagar]) is the largest city and the summer capital of Jammu and Kashmir, India. It lies in the Kashmir Valley on the banks of the Jhelum River, a tributary of the Indus, and Dal and Anchar lakes. The city is known for its natural environment, gardens, waterfronts and houseboats. It is known for traditional Kashmiri handicrafts like the Kashmir shawl (made of pashmina and cashmere wool), and also dried fruits.[11][12] It is the 31st-most populous city in India, the northernmost city in India to have over one million people,[13] and the second-largest metropolitan area in the Himalayas (after Kathmandu, Nepal).
  Tourism
  Srinagar is one of several places that have been called the "Venice of the East".[46][47][48] Lakes around the city include Dal Lake – noted for its houseboats – and Nigeen Lake. Apart from Dal Lake and Nigeen Lake, Wular Lake and Manasbal Lake both lie to the north of Srinagar. Wular Lake is one of the largest fresh water lakes in Asia.
  
  Srinagar has some Mughal gardens, forming a part of those laid by the Mughal emperors across the Indian subcontinent. Those of Srinagar and its close vicinity include Chashma Shahi (the royal fountains); Pari Mahal (the palace of the fairies); Nishat Bagh (the garden of spring); Shalimar Bagh; the Naseem Bagh. Jawaharlal Nehru Memorial Botanical Garden is a botanical garden in the city, set up in 1969.[49] The Indian government has included these gardens under "Mughal Gardens of Jammu and Kashmir" in the tentative list for sites to be included in world Heritage sites.
  
  The Sher Garhi Palace houses administrative buildings from the state government.[50] Another palace of the Maharajas, the Gulab Bhavan, has now become the Lalit Grand Palace hotel.[51]
  
  The Shankaracharya Temple lies on a hill top in the middle of the city.[52]
