  Sunset at Mount Abu
  Mount Abu town, the only hill station in Rajasthan, is at an elevation of 1,220 m (4,003 ft). It has been a popular retreat from the heat of Rajasthan and neighboring Gujarat for centuries.
  
  The mountain is home to several Hindu temples, including the Adhar Devi Temple (also known as Arbuda Devi Temple), carved out of the solid rock; the Shri Raghunathji Temple; and a shrine and temple to Dattatreya built atop the Guru Shikhar peak; and the Achaleshwar Mahadev Temple (1412).
  
  The Achalgarh Fort, built in the 14th century by Kumbha of Mewar, is nearby and at its center is the popular visitor attraction of the Nakki Lake. The Toad Rock is on a hill near the lake. Close to the fort is the Achaleshwar Mahadev Temple, a popular Shiva temple. Also, Achal Fort Jain Temple, Kantinath Jain Temple (1513) is equally famous.
  
  The Durga Ambika Mata Temple lies in a cleft of rock in Jagat, just outside Mount Abu town.
  
  The mountain is also the home to a number of Jain temples including Dilwara Temples, a complex of temples carved out of white marble. The Dilwara Temples or Delvada Temples are located about 2½ kilometers from the Mount Abu town. These Jain temples were built by Vimal Shah and designed by Vastupala, Jain ministers of Dholka,[10] between the 11th and 16th centuries and are famous for their use of white marble and intricate marble carvings.[11] They are a pilgrimage place of the Jains, and a popular general tourist attraction. The temples have an opulent entranceway, the simplicity in architecture reflecting Jain values like honesty and frugality.[12] Minutely-carved ornamental detail covers the ceilings, doorways, pillars, and panels.[13] The temple complex is in the midst of a range of forested hills. There are five temples in all, each with its own unique identity.[14] All five temples are enclosed within a single high walled compound. The group is named after the small village of Dilwara or Delvara in which they are located. The five temples are:
  
  Vimal Vasahi, dedicated to the first Jain Tirthankara, Shri Rishabhadev.
  Luna Vasahi, dedicated to the 22nd Jain Tirthankara, Shri Neminatha.
  Pittalhar, dedicated to the first Jain Tirthankar, Shri Rishabhadev.
  Parshvanath, dedicated to the 23rd Jain Tirthankara, Shri Parshvanatha.
  Mahavir Swami, dedicated to the last Jain Tirthankara, Shri Mahaviraswami.
  Among all the five legendary marble temples of Dilwara, the most famous of those are the Vimal Vasahi and the Luna Vasahi temples.[15][16]
  
  In Mount Abu, the faith community of Brahma Kumaris has its spiritual headquarters, which are represented by its own account in 110 countries.[17] Every year about 2.5 million visitors are supposed to visit the sprawling campus of that spiritual movement.[17] The Brahma Kumaris ashram has a museum that displays the knowledge that Lord Shiva gave to the Prajapita Brahma. The 50-acre land also provides ample space for meditation and spiritual learning as well as to connect yourself to the stunning, undisturbed natural surroundings.
  
  The Mount Abu Wildlife Sanctuary was established in 1960 and covers 290 km² of the mountain. The sanctuary encircles the town, and sloth bears from the sanctuary have habitually been seen inside the city throughout the year foraging on hotel waste in open rubbish bins.[18]
