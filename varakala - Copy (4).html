<p>Varkala, IPA: [ʋar̥kala] is a major coastal municipality situated in the northern suburb of Trivandrum, capital city of the Indian state of Kerala. It is the headquarters of Varkala Taluk and important government institutions such as the taluk office, court complex, office of the Deputy Superintendent of Police, Legal Metrology Inspector office, Excise Circle and Range office, RTO, Treasury and Mini civil station are situated in here. It is one among the oldest municipalities of Kerala established on 1980.

  Varkala is the only region in southern Kerala where cliffs are found adjacent to the Arabian Sea.[3] These Cenozoic sedimentary formation cliffs are a unique geological feature on the otherwise flat Kerala coast, and are known among geologists as Varkala Formation. The cliffs have been declared a national geological monument by the Geological Survey of India for their protection, maintenance, promotion, and the enhancement of geotourism. There are numerous water spouts and spas on the sides of these cliffs. In 2015, the Ministry of Mines, the Government of India, and the Geological Survey of India (GSI) declared Varkala Cliffs a geo-heritage site.[4][5]
  
  Varkala is also known for the 2,000-year-old Janardana Swami Temple, which is an important Vaishnavaite shrine in India and is often referred to as Dakshin Kashi (Benares of the South).[6] The temple is located close to Papanasam beach, which is an Ayurveda treatment centre. The temple has an ancient bell removed from a shipwreck, donated by the captain of the Dutch vessel which sank near Varkala without causing any casualties.
  
  Another major landmark in Varkala is the Sivagiri Mutt, established by the social reformer Sree Narayana Guru.
  Tourism began to thrive at the end of the last century at Varkala beach (Papanasam), which was earlier famous for Vavu Beli, a Hindu custom performed at the beach. Another beach is at Tiruvambadi, one kilometre away and on the way to the old palace. An island called Ponnumthuruthu is close to Varkala and is also a tourist attraction.

Many ayurvedic massage parlours line the promenade above the beach.[citation needed]

Varkala Beach
Varkala Beach, or Papanasam Beach, is a heaven for sunbathing and swimming. It also offers adventurous activities in water sports. Special authentic Kerala style local food can also be experienced along the cliff.[citation needed] The cliff and the beach include resorts, restaurants, and other shops. The black part of the sand on Varkala Beach contains Thorium-oxide, which is a radioactive substance. Thorium and Thorium-oxide and its isotopes are found all over Kerala and can be identified by their black colour.[15]

Cremations
Sections of Varkala Beach (Papanasam Beach) are used by Indians to scatter the ashes of their cremated relatives into the sea. Despite this burial activity, the sea is popular with swimmers both local and foreign.[citation needed]

The bridge over the lake is a vantage point to view the backwater stretching white and grey to the distant blue horizon. Boating is another way to browse this waterway.

Anjengo Fort
Anjengo Fort is a fort near Varkala. The historic significance tagged to Anjengo comes through foreign powers like the Portuguese, the Dutch, and finally the English East India Company.

At Anjengo, one can find the remnants of the old English Fort, which was targeted several times by other foreign powers, who were at that time fighting each other to get a firm footing in Kerala. The fort is now under the protection of National Heritage Monuments. There is also a cemetery inside the fort and the oldest burial site dates to 1704. Muthalapuzhi Lake is situated in Anjengo.
