<p>Lavasa (Marathi: lavāsā) is a private,[1] planned city built near Pune, India.[2] It is stylistically based on the Italian town Portofino, with a street and several buildings bearing the name of that town.

  A 100-square-kilometre (39 sq mi)[1] or 32-square-kilometre (12 sq mi)[3] project being developed by HCC,[4] this as-yet-incomplete city has been controversial for multiple reasons including procurement of land,[5] harm to the environment,[1] and loans acquired through political corruption.[6]
  
  In late 2010, the Indian Environment and Forests Ministry ordered that construction cease because the project violated environmental laws.[7] As of late 2011, this order has been rescinded.[8] The project's scale may have been reduced, however, and an initial public offering may not occur.[8] The head of the company working on the project said in 2013 that due to the Environment and Forests Ministry, the project had "lost three years".[9]
  Billed as India's first hill station since independence,[10] this private city is being constructed by a unit of Ajit Gulabchand.[11] The architectural team responsible for the design of the town wants it be an imitation of an Italian hill-side town[12]

Land
The area demarcated for Lavasa is located near Pune in the Mulshi valley[5] of the Western Ghats.[13]

Current progress
Construction of two out of the five planned towns is ongoing, and a number of residences have been completed as of 2013.[9] By 2011 four hotels and a city centre were completed.[14] A primary, middle, and high school, Le Mont High, has been constructed as well.[15] The town also boasts a hospitality management college, École hôtelière Lavasa.[16]

Administration
Scot Wrighton was the administrator of the city as of 2011 and held the office until 2019.[17][18]

Surrounding village
Smaller, pre-existing communities sometimes interact with Lavasa and its residents. Some have been the focus of CSR efforts,[19] and villagers provide construction labour to the project.[20]
