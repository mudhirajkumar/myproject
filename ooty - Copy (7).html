  Ooty (listen (help·info)), officially known as Udhagamandalam (also known as Ootacamund (listen (help·info)); abbreviated as Udhagai), is a town[4] and a municipality in the Nilgiris district of the South Indian state of Tamil Nadu. It is located 86 km (53 mi) north west of Coimbatore ,100 km (65 mi) north west of Tirupur[5] ,128 km (80 mi) south of Mysore and is the headquarters of the Nilgiris district. It is a popular hill station located in the Nilgiri Hills. It is popularly called the "Queen of Hill Stations". It was the summer capital of the Madras Presidency.

Originally occupied by the Badaga and Toda people, the area came under the rule of the East India Company at the end of the 18th century. The economy is based on tourism and agriculture, along with the manufacture of medicines and photographic film. The town is connected by the Nilgiri ghat roads and Nilgiri Mountain Railway. Its natural environment attracts tourists and it is a popular summer destination.[6] In 2011, the town had a population of 88,430.[2]
Udhagamandalam was originally a tribal land occupied by the Badaga, Toda, Kota, Irula and Kurumba people.

The Toda in Nilgiris are first referenced in a record belonging to Hoysala king Vishnuvardhana and his general Punisa, dated 1117 CE.[11] The Toda people were known for raising water buffalo. The people known for farming activities.[12] Nilgiris was ruled by various dynasties like Satavahanas, Gangas, Kadambas, Rashtrakutas, Hoysalas, the Vijayanagara empire and the Rajas of Ummattur (on behalf of Wodeyars of Mysuru).[11][13][14][15][16] Tipu Sultan captured Nilgiris in the eighteenth century and extended the border by constructing a hideout cave-like structure.[12] The Nilgiris came into possession of British East India Company as part of the ceded lands, held by Tipu Sultan, by the treaty of Srirangapatnam in 1799.

In 1818, J. C. Whish and N. W. Kindersley, assistants to John Sullivan, then Collector of Coimbatore, visited Ooty and submitted a report to him. Sullivan camped at Dimbhatti, north of Kotagiri in January 1819 and was enthralled by the beauty of the place. He wrote to Thomas Munro, " ... it resembles Switzerland, more than any country of Europe... the hills beautifully wooded and fine strong spring with running water in every valley."[17] The Badagas of Dimbhatti ceded that part of the town to Sullivan and in May 1819, he began to build his bungalow at Dimbhatti. He also started work on a road from Sirumugai to Dimbhatti that year. The road was completed in May 1823, and extended up to Coonoor by 1830–32.[7]

Aranmore Palace in Ooty, served as the summer capital of the Madras Presidency; it was visited by British officials during the colonial days as a popular summer resort.[18] Soldiers were sent to nearby Wellington to recuperate. Wellington is the home of the Madras Regiment of the Indian Army.[19][20] After Independence, it developed into a popular hill resort.
Ooty is a popular tourist attraction with many places of interest in and around the town.

Gardens and parks

Botanical Garden in Ooty

The Government Botanical Garden
The Government Rose Garden (formerly Centenary Rose Park)[26][27] is the largest rose garden in India.[28] It is situated on the slopes of the Elk Hill in Vijayanagaram of Ooty town.[29] at an altitude of 2,200 metres (7,200 ft). Today this garden has one of the largest collection of roses in the country with more than 20,000 varieties of roses of 2,800 cultivars.[30] The collection includes hybrid tea roses, Miniature Roses, Polyanthas, Papagena, Floribunda, Ramblers, Yakimour and roses of unusual colours like black and green.


Xerochrysum bracteatum – Everlasting flower from Ooty
The 8.9-hectare (22-acre) Ooty Botanical Gardens was laid out in 1847[31] and is maintained by the Government of Tamil Nadu. The Botanical Garden is lush, green, and well-maintained. A flower show along with an exhibition of rare plant species is held every May. The gardens have around a thousand species, both exotic and indigenous, of plants, shrubs, ferns, trees, herbal and bonsai plants.[32] The garden has a 20-million-year-old fossilised tree.[33][34]

Deer Park is located on the edge of Ooty Lake. It is the highest altitude zoo in India aside from the zoo in Nainital, Uttarakhand. This park was formed to house a number of species of deer and other animals.[35]

Lakes and dams

Ooty Lake
Ooty lake covers an area of 26 hectares (65 acres).[36] The boat house established alongside the lake, which offers boating facilities to tourists, is a major tourist attraction in Ooty. It was constructed in 1824 by John Sullivan, the first collector of Ooty. The lake was formed by damming the mountain streams flowing down Ooty valley.[36] The lake is set among groves of Eucalyptus trees with a railway line running along one bank. During the summer season in May, boat races and boat pageantry are organised for two days at the lake.[37][38]

Pykara is a river located 19 km (12 mi) from Ooty.[39] The Pykara is considered very sacred by the Todas.[40] The Pykara river rises at Mukurthi peak and passes through a hilly tract, generally keeping to the north and turns to the west after reaching the plateau's edge.[40] The river flows through a series of cascades; and the last two falls of 55 metres (180 ft) and 61 metres (200 ft) are known as Pykara falls.[40] The falls are approximately 6 km (3.7 mi) from the bridge on the main road. A boat house by the Pykara falls and dam is an added attraction to tourists.[39][41] Kamaraj Sagar Dam (also known as Sandynalla reservoir)[42] is located 10 km (6.2 mi) from the Ooty bus stand.[43][44] It is a picnic spot and a film shoot location on the slopes of the Wenlock Downs.[45] The various tourist activities at the dam include fishing and studying nature and the environment.[46] Parsons Valley Reservoir is the primary water source for the town and is mainly in a reserved forest and thus largely off-limits to visitors. Emerald Lake, Avalanche Lake and Porthimund Lake are other lakes in the region.

Tribal huts and museum

Traditional Toda Dogle
There are a few traditional Toda Houses (known as Dogles) on the hills above the Botanical Garden, where Todas still dwell. There are other Toda settlements in the area, notably Kandal Mund near Old Ooty. Although many Toda have abandoned their traditional distinctive huts for concrete houses,[47] a movement is now afoot to build tradition barrel-vaulted huts, and during the last decade forty new huts have been built and many Toda sacred dairies renovated.[48]

The Tribal Museum is part of the campus of Tribal Research Centre which is in Muthorai Palada (10 km or 6.2 mi from Ooty town). It is home to rare artifacts and photographs of tribal groups of Tamil Nadu as well as the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, and anthropological and archaeological primitive human culture and heritage. The Tribal Museum also displays houses belonging to Toda, Kota, Paniya, Kurumba, and Kanikarans.

Nilgiri Mountain Railway
Nilgiri Mountain Railway
Nilgiri Mountain Railway
The Nilgiri Mountain Railway was built by the British in 1908,[49] and was initially operated by the Madras Railway Company. The railway still relies on its fleet of steam locomotives.[50][51] NMR comes under the jurisdiction of the newly formed Salem Division. In July 2005, UNESCO added the Nilgiri Mountain Railway as an extension to the World Heritage Site of Darjeeling Himalayan Railway, the site then became known as "Mountain Railways of India."[52] after it satisfied the necessary criteria, thus forcing abandonment of the modernisation plans. For the past several years diesel locomotives have taken over from steam on the section between Coonoor and Udhagamandalam. Local people and tourists have led a demand for steam locos to once again haul this section.[50]

Historical buildings

Fernhills Palace
Stone House is the first bungalow constructed in Ooty. It was built by John Sullivan and was called Kal Bangala by the tribals (Kal means stone in local tribal language). John Sullivan started building Stone House in 1822, acquiring land from the Todas at ₹1 per acre or ₹2.5 per hectare.[17] Today, it is the official residence for the principal of the Government Arts College, Ooty[53][54]


St. Stephen's Church
St Stephen's Church is located on the road to Mysore in Ooty,[55] in the state of Tamil Nadu, India. It is one of the oldest churches in the Nilgiris district.[56][57] The church dates back to the 19th century. Stephen Rumbold Lushington, the then governor of Madras, who keenly felt the need for a cathedral in Ooty which was exclusively for the British, laid the foundation stone for the church on 23 April 1829, to coincide with the birthday of King George IV. St Stephen's Church was consecrated by John Matthias Turner, Bishop of Calcutta, on 5 November 1830. It was thrown open to public communion on Easter Sunday 3 April 1831. It came under the Church of South India in 1947.[37] The architect in charge was John James Underwood, Captain, Madras Regiment.[58]

St. Thomas Church, a parish in the Anglican diocese of Ooty,[59] was begun in 1867, with the foundation stone being laid on 1 May by Lt. Gen. Howard Dowker. Construction was completed 20 October 1870, and its first service was held in 1871.[60] Among the famous graves in the churchyard are those of Josiah John Goodwin, the British stenographer of Swami Vivekananda, and William Patrick Adam, the British governor of Madras, whose grave is topped by the stunning pillar monument dedicated to St. Thomas, the tallest structure in Ooty. The church's graveyard was used as a setting in David Lean's 1984 movie, A Passage to India, which was based on E. M. Forster's novel of the same name.[61][62]

In 1882, the rules of the game of snooker were first drafted and codified in the "Ooty Club" by Sir Neville Chamberlain (not the Prime Minister). The club still houses the billiards table that was used.[63][64]

Tea Factory
Spread over an area of nearly zero point four zero hectares (one acre) of land, the Ooty Tea Factory is situated close to Ooty town. Visitors can learn about the origin of different kinds of tea leaves all across the globe and the history of tea in India. In the factory, the process of tea processing by Cut, Twist and Curl (CTC) machines is clearly displayed. At the end of the visit, one can taste different types of tea and buy tea souvenirs. Other nearby tea factories include Doddabetta Tea factory and Bench Mark Tea Factory.

Radio Telescope
The Ooty Radio Telescope was completed in 1970. It is part of the National Centre for Radio Astrophysics (NCRA)[65][66][67] of the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR), which is funded by the Government of India through the Department of Atomic Energy
