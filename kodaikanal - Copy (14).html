Boating in Kodaikanal Lake
Kodaikanal was established in 1845 as a refuge from the high temperatures and tropical diseases of the plains.[4] Much of the local economy is based on the hospitality industry serving tourism. As of 2011, the city had a population of 36,501.
Kodaikanal has several scenic natural attractions which attract visitors and make it a destination for newlyweds. Young people also come for bike trips and leisure.[citation needed] It is also known for home made chocolates and eucalyptus oil.[citation needed]

These are described in order of distance from the bus-stand.


Upper lake view in Kodaikanal
Kodaikanal Lake is an artificial, roughly star-shaped 45-hectare (110-acre) lake built in 1863. It is Kodaikanal's most popular geographic landmark and tourist attraction.[citation needed] Rowboats and pedalos can be hired at the Kodaikanal Boat Club. Horses and bicycles can be hired beside the lake for short periods. The 5 kilometres (3.1 mi) path that skirts the periphery of this lake is a favourite walk for locals and tourists alike.


Bryant Park
Bryant Park: Just east of the lake and 500 metres (1,600 ft) from the bus stand is a well maintained 8.3-hectare (20.5-acre) botanical garden. The park was planned and built in 1908 by a forest officer from Madurai, H.D. Bryant, and named after him. With 325 species of trees, shrubs, and cacti, the park is a rainbow of flowers during the peak season. A large section is dedicated to nearly 740 varieties of roses. 59th Flower show is conducted after the gap of two year in 2022. The annual flower show is held in Kodaikanal in the first or second week of may.


Flower show in Bryant Park
There is an 1857 eucalyptus tree and a Bodhi tree which adds a religious significance to the park. Ornamental plants are cultivated in a nursery for sale. The park organizes horticultural exhibits and flower shows every summer, to coincide with the peak season. The entrance fee to the park is nominal, and it is open all year.[32]


Coaker's Walk (1900)

View from Coaker's Walk
Coaker's Walk, 500 metres (1,600 ft) from the bus-stand, constructed by Lt. Coaker in 1872, is a 1-kilometre (3,300 ft) paved pedestrian path running along the edge of steep slopes on the southern side of Kodai. The walk, winding around Mount Nebo, starts in front of the Van Allen hospital, running parallel to the Van Allen Hospital Road, and joins the main road beside St.Peter's Church, providing a panoramic view of the plains. On a clear day one can view as far as Dolphin's Nose in the south, the valley of the Pambar River in the southeast, Periyakulam town and even the city of Madurai. A fascinating rare phenomenon called the Brocken spectre can be witnessed, when a person can see his shadow on the clouds with a rainbow halo. This occurs when the sun is behind the viewer and clouds and mist are to the front. There is an observatory with a telescope halfway along the walk. The entrance fee to the walkway is nominal and it is open all year.

Poombarai Village (Kudhanthai Velappar Temple) is 15 kilometres (9.3 mi) from the bus-stand. In Poombarai village there is a temple of Lord Muruga. The village is fully covered by reserve forest. The final approach to this quiet area is a gently climbing foot-path.

The stairway leading up to it is highly commercialized and lined with rows of shops to tempt tourists.[33]

Kodaikanal Solar Observatory
Kodaikanal Solar Observatory, 6 kilometres (3.7 mi) from the bus-stand on Observatory Road, at 2,343 metres (7,687 ft) is the highest location near Kodai. The first observations were commenced here in 1901.[36] Former Director John Evershed discovered the phenomenon of radial motion in sunspots, now known as the Evershed effect. The Kodaikanal Terrestrial Telescope can view a grand panorama including Sothupparai Dam, Vaigai Dam, Periyakulam and Varaha river. This Indian Institute of Astrophysics facility has a comprehensive astronomical science museum with organized public tours, access to the astronomy library, and scheduled night-time telescopic sky viewing. It is open daily to the public during peak season, and a few hours each Friday the rest of the year.[37]


Pillar Rock view with and without mist
Pillar Rocks, 8 kilometres (5.0 mi) from the bus-stand, is a set of three giant rock pillars which stand 122 metres (400 ft) high.[38] Managed by the Tamil Nadu Forest Department, The viewpoint can be crowded but is not commercialized. There is an excellent public garden adjacent to the viewpoint.

Bear Shola Falls[39] Silver Cascade is the name given to these seasonal waterfalls. Bears were known to come here in search of drinking water many years ago, hence the name. They're in full swing after the monsoon and make for a fantastic experience, especially if you're fascinated by waterfalls.


Pillar Rocks
Guna caves,[40] made popular by the Tamil movie Gunaa, previously called Devil's Kitchen, are deep bat-infested chambers between the three gigantic boulders that are the Pillar Rocks. The deep narrow ravines of the caves are now closed to public due to the deaths of twelve youths there.[41] These dangerous caves are highly protected now, and tourists can see sections of the cave system from afar.[42] In the late 1970s the inside of the caves was well photographed.[43]


Silver Cascade Falls
Silver Cascade, 8 kilometres (5.0 mi) from Kodaikanal at a wide bend in the long and winding Laws Ghat Road, at altitude 1,800 metres (5,900 ft), is a 55-metre (180 ft) waterfall formed from the outflow of Kodaikanal Lake.[44] This waterfall is a common stop for first-time visitors.[citation needed] There are a few souvenir and fruit vendors and many monkeys here. There is also a smaller waterfall below the bridge which crosses the stream here.[citation needed]


Silver Cascade Waterfall is formed from the outflow of Kodaikanal Lake.

It is an undisturbed area 1 kilometre (0.62 mi) down a steep rocky trail beginning soon after Pambar Bridge. Views of steep rocky escarpments rising from the plains can be seen. The old village of Vellagavi can be reached through a rugged bridle path here.
